# Multi-Lingual-Summarization-System-English-Hindi-Spanish

Nice — this is a fantastic project to showcase on GitHub and your resume. Below I’ll give a **complete, end-to-end plan** for a **Multi-Lingual Abstractive Summarization System (English, Hindi, Spanish)**: architecture, datasets, preprocessing, modeling choices, training recipes, evaluation, deployment, repo layout, timelines, and resume-ready bullets. I’ll keep it practical and actionable so you can start building right away.

# Project summary (one-line)

Build and deploy a multilingual abstractive summarizer that produces fluent, concise summaries in English, Hindi and Spanish from one or more input documents (news, research, meeting transcripts), using transformer architectures and production-ready inference.

---

# Goals & impact

* Demonstrate mastery of transformers, tokenization, multilingual training, long-text handling, and deployment.
* Show evaluation beyond ROUGE: faithfulness, factuality, and human evaluation.
* Publish model weights + demo, and quantify improvements vs. baselines (e.g., extractive baseline, multilingual off-the-shelf models).

---

# High-level architecture

1. **Ingestion**: documents (single or multiple) → language detection → normalization.
2. **Preprocessing / Chunking**: handle long documents with semantic chunking or hierarchical grouping.
3. **Encoder–Decoder model**: multilingual seq2seq (mT5 / mBART / LongT5 / mBART-50) fine-tuned for summarization. Consider adapter layers / LoRA.
4. **Fusion / Hierarchical module**: if multi-doc or long inputs — chunk summaries → merge & summarize (hierarchical summarization).
5. **Post-processing & language polishing**: detokenize, optionally apply a small language-model rewriter for fluency.
6. **Evaluation & filtering**: automatic metrics + human checks + faithfulness verifier (QA/entailment).
7. **Serving**: FastAPI + Gradio demo; host model on HF Hub or a GPU server; optimize for latency (quantization, ONNX, batching).

# Datasets (what to use / combine)

* **Multilingual summarization datasets**:

  * *XL-Sum* — cross-language summarization (news) covering many languages including Hindi & Spanish.
  * *MLSUM* — news summarization (English, Spanish, French) — good for Spanish.
  * *Multi-News* / CNN-DailyMail — for English multi-document summarization (can be used as English data).
  * Domain-specific sets (arXiv/PubMed) if you want research summarization — note these are English-heavy.
* **Synthetic / augmentation**:

  * Back-translation to augment low-resource languages (translate English pairs → Hindi/Spanish and use as pseudo-targets).
  * Round-trip translation to create multi-lingual training cases.
* **Custom**:

  * Scrape news portals (with licenses respected) to create additional paired examples; or use government/corporate meeting transcripts you have permission to use.

(Plan to mix datasets and create a balanced sampling schedule so the model learns all three languages without catastrophic forgetting.)

---

# Preprocessing & tokenization

1. **Language detection** (fastText langid or langdetect) for routing & statistics.
2. **Normalization**:

   * Unicode normalization (NFKC), punctuation normalization, remove boilerplate.
   * Hindi: Devanagari normalization (unicode-aware), fix spacing around punctuation.
3. **Tokenization**:

   * Use a multilingual tokenizer that matches your base model (mT5 tokenizer, mBART tokenizer, or a SentencePiece vocabulary).
   * For long inputs prefer tokenizers that support byte-level BPE or SentencePiece to reduce OOVs across scripts.
4. **Chunking long docs**:

   * Semantic chunking (paragraph/section boundaries) or sliding windows with overlap (e.g., 512 tokens window, 128 overlap).
   * For hierarchical approach: (a) generate summaries per chunk, (b) summarize concatenated chunk summaries.
5. **Metadata**:

   * Keep source, language, position (page/paragraph id) in metadata to help with citation-aware summaries.

# Modeling choices (practical options)

Pick one main architecture and a couple of experiments:

**A. mT5 / mT5-large** (strong multilingual seq2seq)

* Pros: Designed for multilingual generation, works well for summarization tasks.
* Use: fine-tune for each language jointly (multilingual head) or fine-tune multilingual weights then adapter per language.

**B. mBART-50 / mBART-large** (multilingual denoising seq2seq)

* Pros: Strong cross-lingual generation, good for translation + summarization style tasks.

**C. LongT5 / LED / BigBird** (for long-document summarization)

* Pros: Handles long inputs natively; use with multilingual tokenizers if available or use pretraining on multilingual long text.

**D. Hybrid: extractive + abstractive**

* First pass: extract top-k salient sentences using TF-IDF or a neural scorer (Sentence-BERT), then generate abstractive summary conditioned on extracts.
* Improves faithfulness and reduces hallucination.

**Parameter-efficient fine-tuning**:

* Use **LoRA**, **adapters**, or **prefix-tuning** to save resources and enable quick language-specific adaptation.

---

# Training recipes & strategies

1. **Joint multilingual fine-tune**: Mix training batches across EN/HIN/ES with balanced sampling (e.g., oversample low-resource language).
2. **Curriculum learning**: Start fine-tuning on English (large data) then gradually introduce Hindi & Spanish, or use temperature sampling.
3. **Multi-task objective**: Primary summarization loss + auxiliary tasks (language id, sentence scoring) to strengthen language signals.
4. **Coverage / repetition penalty**: Add loss terms or generation penalties to avoid copy/redundancy.
5. **Evaluation-in-loop**: periodically evaluate ROUGE/BERTScore on held-out sets and use early stopping.
6. **Data augmentation**: back-translation and pseudo-labelling for lower-resource language (Hindi) to enlarge dataset.
7. **Fine-tune hyperparams**: fp16 mixed precision, LR schedulers (warmup + cosine), batch size per GPU, gradient accumulation for large effective batch sizes.

---

# Handling long documents (practical patterns)

* **Hierarchical summarization**:

  1. Chunk input into N segments.
  2. Summarize each segment (short summaries).
  3. Concatenate segment summaries and run final summarizer.
* **Memory/Retriever + Summarizer**:

  * Use retrieval over segments to pick most relevant passages for the question/summary request.
* **Long-models**:

  * Use LongT5/LED/BigBird if you want a single-pass solution over thousands of tokens.

---

# Evaluation (metrics & human checks)

**Automatic metrics**:

* ROUGE-1/2/L, METEOR (optional), BERTScore (semantic similarity).
* Language-specific evaluation: ensure tokenization & normalization align before scoring.

**Faithfulness / Factuality**:

* QA-based evaluation: generate QA pairs from reference and check if model answers them correctly on generated summary.
* Entailment-based scoring: check if summary is entailed by source using an NLI model.

**Human evaluation** (critical for summarization):

* Rate 200 samples for: *fluency*, *coherence*, *informativeness*, *faithfulness*, *redundancy*.
* Present inter-annotator agreement.

**Ablations to report**:

* Joint vs per-language fine-tune.
* Pure abstractive vs extractive+abstractive hybrid.
* With vs without back-translation augmentation.
* Hierarchical pipeline vs single-model long input.

---

# Inference & runtime considerations

* **Translation-based fallback**: If a strong English summarizer exists, you can translate non-English docs → summarize in English → translate back — but this can harm fluency and faithfulness. Use only as last resort.
* **Latency**: smaller models or LoRA adapters for faster inference; batch requests and caching identical inputs.
* **Quantization**: 8-bit quantization or ONNX conversion for CPU deployments; use BF16/FP16 on GPU.
* **Language routing**: auto-detect language and route to appropriate model/adapter for better results.

---

# Deployment & demo

1. **Model hosting**:

   * Hugging Face Hub (upload model & tokenizer) — good for visibility.
   * Self-hosted inference with `transformers` + `accelerate` / `optimum` on GPU servers.
2. **API**:

   * FastAPI endpoints: `/summarize` (POST: {texts, language, options}), `/batch_summarize`, `/health`.
3. **Frontend demo**:

   * Gradio or Streamlit web app: upload multiple docs, choose output language, adjustable length level (concise/medium/long), show source highlights & confidence.
4. **Containerize & CI**:

   * Dockerfile for inference server, GitHub Actions for building & tests, push to container registry.
5. **Edge / mobile**:

   * For lightweight inference (short inputs): convert to ONNX/TFLite and run on CPU/mobile; otherwise use cloud inference and serve mobile clients via API.

---

# Explainability & safety

* Show *source highlighting* — for each sentence in summary, show the top source chunk(s) supporting it (retrieval scores).
* Implement an “I don’t know” policy: if the model confidence or grounding is low, flag summary or ask for manual review.
* Add model card with limitations, license, training data provenance, and biases.

# Experiment tracking & reproducibility

* Use Weights & Biases or MLflow to track hyperparameters, metrics, and artifacts.
* Save random seeds, tokenizer versions, HF model IDs, and hardware specs in the experiment logs.
* Provide scripts for reproducing core experiments (train + eval).

---

# Practical timeline & compute estimate

* **Week 1**: Data collection + preprocessing pipeline + baseline extractive summarizer.
* **Week 2–3**: Fine-tune mT5-small / mBART on multilingual datasets (English + Spanish first). Implement chunking & hierarchical pipeline.
* **Week 4**: Add Hindi (back-translation augmentation if needed) and run ablations.
* **Week 5**: Evaluation (automatic + human sampling) and implement faithfulness checks.
* **Week 6**: Build API + Gradio demo, containerize, publish model to HF Hub, write README & model card.
  **Compute**: mT5-small/medium fine-tuning can be done on a single 16–32GB GPU; mT5-large / long models require multiple GPUs or cloud TPUs. Use LoRA/adapter techniques to reduce compute.

---

# Resume / GitHub bullets (copy-paste)
